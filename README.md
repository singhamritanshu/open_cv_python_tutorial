Please add your own vidoe in test_videos folder. Otherwise you will get error. Any random video will work and do make sure that either you change the video name to 1.mp4 or you can also change the name in file "read_display.py" at line number 11 which is "capture = cv.VideoCapture('test_videos/1.mp4')", just change from 1.mp4 to you video name.
