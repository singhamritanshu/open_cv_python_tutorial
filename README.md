Made with the help of "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXlwWbU8l2o".

Please add your own vidoe in test_videos folder. Otherwise you will get error 'OpenCV: Couldn't read video stream from file "test_videos/1.mp4" '. Any random video will work and do make sure that either you change the video name to 1.mp4 or you can also change the name in file "read_display.py" at line number 11 which is "capture = cv.VideoCapture('test_videos/1.mp4')", just change from 1.mp4 to you video name.
